Butlr presents tasks to you based on designated locations. You can organize tasks by places, such as Home, Work, Grocery Store, etc. and Butlr will present you with your saved lists for each individual location when you arrive at the said location. When you get home, Butlr will present you with the list you created specifically for home, which would include tasks such as take out the trash, wash the dishes, watch a movie with your family, etc. For work, the list might include things like meeting dates and times, reports, other assignments, etc. and when you come to work, Butlr will automatically present you your itinerary for the day. Driving and you forget to get milk on the way? No problem. Butlr will even handle that for you by sending you a text message to remind you to complete that task.
